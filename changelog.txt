Commit 001: Initial commit.

Commit 002: I should have been committing for every major event/change, but I didn't. Most of this was done late at night after the kids were fast asleep. I woke up in a panic, thinking I had overslept for work, but it was only 10 PM. This project is primarily a refresher, but I might use it for something more. So far, I've turned every section from the original homepage into a component or page, added React Router, and created a JSON file to store navigation link data, making it easy to add, edit, and remove links as needed. Brad and I also added a layout section and an active status for navLinks. Additionally, I handled the shortening of job listings differently by using useState to apply a line-clamp and changing some styling for aesthetics. One card fully showing its description looked off next to two others with a lot of white space, so these changes keep them aligned. I hope this all makes sense to you, reader. Apologies if it doesn't. Go watch the tutorial!

Commit 003: Added json-server

commit 004: We are now fetching jobs data using json-server in jobListings.jsx using async await fetch within a useEffect hook. We've also added react spinners. Cool.
